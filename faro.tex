%Requiring precision assembly in tough industrial environments, components used
% in shipbuilding and naval engineering must be verified against design specifications to ensure proper fit.

%Providing a fast and accurate way to inspect ship parts and components during
% boat construction, portable 3D measurement solutions from FARO, such as the
% FARO Laser Tracker, can be used to install components directly to the ship
% itself. Digitizing hulls and existing conditions, 3D laser scanning solutions
% from FARO allows for the captures of 3D as-built documentation for repair or
% restoration.
